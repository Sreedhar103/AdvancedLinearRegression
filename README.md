# House Sale Price Prediction System (Advanced Linear Regression Assignment)
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. company wants to know which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house and how well those variables describe the price of a house.

Problem Statement: The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market

## General Information
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. company wants to know which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house and how well those variables describe the price of a house.



## Conclusions
 - inal Observations - -- GrLivArea,OverallQual,GarageArea,OverallCond,BsmtQual --Are top 5 positively correlated with Sale Price i.e If these values increase the sale price also increases.

-- MSZoning_RM,Neighborhood_Edwards,PropertyAge,MSSubClass,BsmtExposure_No --Are top 5 negatively correlated with Sale Price i.e If these values increase the sale price decreases.

--We can finalise the Lasso model as it has got down the features to 54.
